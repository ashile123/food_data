# food_data
CONCLUSION:
The analysis shows that the most sales, profits and also 
the most food produce was recorded during the internationa market.
The data shows a lot of information were massive profits were made,the most food supply,
the price data, the most active country in the markets.
both the retail and wholesales trade system played a major role in the international markets.
as a results of the data, it shows that
Rwanda is the most effective country during the international market
it also shows that the top 3 food produce in africa were the millet(retail) 14.9%, 
rice imported(retail)14.8% and the sorghum retail 14.1%.
Rwanda also has the most food supply thereby making the international market grows well over the year
And moreso, the price visualization show us the the market is growing and improving fast but there is a fluctuation that start around the year 2016-2021 and i strongly think it can be corrected when all the african countries gathered and put more effort to achieve the common goal

RECOMMENDATION
I'd reccommend that some of the african countries with the largest country like egypyt, nigeria and the likes
should play a major role in the markets in other to make the speed of the growth of the market fast and reliable
